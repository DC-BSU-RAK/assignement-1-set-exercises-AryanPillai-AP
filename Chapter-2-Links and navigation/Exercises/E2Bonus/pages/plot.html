    <p>
        Marvel’s Spider-Man (PS4, 2018) follows Peter Parker, a seasoned Spider-Man, in New York City. Peter, working with NYPD Captain Yuri Watanabe, arrests crime lord Wilson Fisk, but this sparks chaos as the Inner Demons, led by Martin Li (Mr. Negative), seize a bioweapon, Devil’s Breath. Peter, a lab assistant to Dr. Otto Octavius, juggles crime-fighting and his personal life, reconnecting with ex-girlfriend Mary Jane Watson, a reporter. Li’s vendetta against Mayor Norman Osborn, tied to childhood experiments, drives a deadly bombing at Osborn’s rally, killing Officer Jefferson Davis. Spider-Man stops Li’s plan to release Devil’s Breath at Grand Central but faces a new threat when Otto, corrupted by his neural interface, becomes Doctor Octopus. Leading the Sinister Six—Electro, Vulture, Rhino, Scorpion—Otto unleashes Devil’s Breath, infecting thousands, including Aunt May. Spider-Man defeats the Six, while Mary Jane exposes Oscorp’s role in creating the bioweapon. In a climactic battle, Peter stops Doc Ock, saving Osborn and securing a cure, but May dies. Peter mentors Miles Morales, bitten by a radioactive spider, and reconciles with Mary Jane, setting up future conflicts with Osborn and Venom.
